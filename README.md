# Customer Segmentation - Excel

Built a clustering to identify major customer segments on demographic and psychographic-based data to optimize the impact of marketing campaigns. Engineered features to obtain new features such as RFM, RFMGroup, and RFMScore for getting more details about the customers' purchasing behaviour.


RFM is a method used to analyze customer value. RFM stands for RECENCY, Frequency, and Monetary.

RECENCY: How recently did the customer visit our website or how recently did a customer purchase?

Frequency: How often do they visit or how often do they purchase?

Monetary: How much revenue we get from their visit or how much do they spend when they purchase?

RFM Analysis is a marketing framework that is used to understand and analyze customer behaviour based on the above three factors RECENCY, Frequency, and Monetary.

The RFM Analysis will help the businesses to segment their customer base into different homogenous groups so that they can engage with each group with different targeted marketing strategies.
